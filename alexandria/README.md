This project was an assignment for Udacity's Android Nanodegree. 

## Project Overview

Was to productionize book booklist and barcode scanner apps, 
taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This 
will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility 
features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.
